# Web-3.5
The days of "web 3.0" were filled with decentralisation and blokchains. But what if this technology could be applied to everyday life? That is what my project, "web 3.5" is. Instead of wasting valuable power on large server farms, which only make global warming worse, what if we could use everybody's computers to host the internet. What if we had decentralised texting, streaming or even websties? Not only would it reduce the world's power consumption, but it would also take it out of the hands of large cooperations. After all, the hacker code dictates that we should promote decentralisation. We should place the internet in the hands of the people who use it, allowing creativity to thrive. This is what my project is all about, providing an interface, an API for a new world. A world in witch there is no barrier to entry apart from a laptop and an internet connection. A world in which computers themselves can callaborate on ideas. A world in which AI can make our lives easier by predicting what where we are walking, and laying out a red carpet in front of us (metaphore).
